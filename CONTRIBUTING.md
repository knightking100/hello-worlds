# How to contribute
- Create a pull request that adds a new `Hello World` program.
- The new file must be named `<language_name>.<extension>`
  - `language_name` can be its aliases. For example `C#` can be `CS` or `CSharp`, `C++` can be `CPP`
  - Please don't use characters that are invalid on Windows or Linux
  - Please, use **first letter** of the file name in uppercase.
- The program output can be `Hello World`, `Hello World!`, `hello world`, `Hello, world`, `hello, world`, etc... 
  - It can print to console, output text to screen or to a file, or use whatever form of output your language supports (e.g a function returning a string/array of char/array of bytes/seeded random number generator/Huffman encoded integer that represents hello world)
- Remember to reference issue [#1](https://github.com/knightking100/hello-worlds/issues/1)
- Only one new language per pull request, please.
- Don't add existing Hello World programs to the repo. You can see them in [#1](https://github.com/knightking100/hello-worlds/issues/1)
  - If there's already an entry for the language, and you're adding a significantly different "Hello World", you can add `_2`, `_3`.. etc to the end of the file name.

## I will merge your pull request as long as it's valid. It might take about 1-24 hours
